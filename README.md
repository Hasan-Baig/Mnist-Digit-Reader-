# **_About Flask Python Digit Reader_**

The web app is written in Python using the Flask web framework. I use JavaScript to collect drawings in an HTML canvas element and Machine Learning (ML) for handwritten digit recognition. The digit recognizer is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset using the Tensorflow software library.

After training, the CNN showed 92.92% accuracy on MNIST's test dataset. To learn all about my architecture checkout my Diagram about it below.

I will cover a much simpler approach, similar to the one used here. Weâ€™ll use

- Fl[Flask](flask.pocoo.org/)to build the API (back-end)
- jquery.ajax to handle requests to the API from your client (front-end)
- I use JavaScript(FabricJs) to allow the user to draw graphics on the fly in an HTML canvas element
