# **_About Flask Python Digit Reader_**

The web app is written in Python using the Flask web framework. I use JavaScript to collect drawings in an HTML canvas element and Machine Learning (ML) for handwritten digit recognition. The digit recognizer is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset using the Tensorflow software library.

After training, the CNN showed 92.92% accuracy on MNIST's test dataset. To learn all about my architecture checkout my Diagram about it below.
